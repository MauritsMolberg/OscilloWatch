## Advanced settings

### Segment analysis settings

* `mirror_padding_fraction` Fraction of the signal that is mirrored at the beginning and end of the segment. Default: 1.0.
* `remove_padding_after_emd` Removes padding by the end of EMD if True, and keeps it if False (includes for HHT). Default: False.
* `remove_padding_after_hht` Removes padding by the end of HHT if True, and keeps it if False. No effect if `remove_padding_after_emd` is True. Default: True.


### EMD settings

* `max_emd_sifting_iterations` Maximum number of sifting iterations before EMD sifting is stopped. Default: 100.
* `emd_min_peaks` Minimum number of both upper and lower peaks in the residual to continue the EMD process. If there are fewer upper ***or*** lower peaks than this number, the EMD process is stopped. The interpolation needs at least 2 points, so if this minimum is set lower than 2, it will automatically be increased to 2. Default: 4.
* `emd_add_edges_to_peaks` Both edge points are included in the lists of upper and lower peaks if True. Default: True.


### HHT settings

* `hht_frequency_resolution` Distance between each value in the discrete frequency axis in the Hilbert spectrum. Default: Same as the inverse of the sampling rate.
* `hht_amplitude_moving_avg_window` Window size used for the moving average filter applied to the instantaneous amplitude curves, measured in number of samples. Default: 5.
* `hht_frequency_moving_avg_window` Window size used for the moving average filter applied to the instantaneous frequency curves, measured in number of samples. Default: 41.
* `hht_split_signal_freq_change_enable` Enables splitting an IMF before Hilbert transforming if its dominating frequency changes abruptly if True. Default: True.
* `hht_split_signal_freq_change_threshold` Minimum amplitude of spike in gradient of dominating frequency for the IMF to be split at the spike before Hilbert transform. No effect if `hht_split_signal_freq_change_toggle` is False. Default: 0.5.
* `hht_split_signal_freq_change_nperseg` Window width of STFT measured in number of samples used for deciding where to split IMFs. No effect if `hht_split_signal_freq_change_toggle` is False. Default: 100.
* `minimum_frequency` Lower bound of frequency axis in Hilbert spectrum. Default: Inverse of the length of the segment plus extension padding (Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem).
* `maximum_frequency` Upper bound of frequency axis in Hilbert spectrum. Default: No upper bound; the highest frequency found in the IMFs will be the highest value in the frequency axis.


### Hilbert spectrum analysis settings

* `minimum_non_zero_improvement` Minimum improvement to number of non-zero elements in combined row from including another row for this new row to be included in the combined row. Default: 3.
* `max_coefficient_of_variation` Maximum coefficient of variation between an amplitude curve with interpolation and the fitted curve before the estimated damping is considered uncertain. Default: 0.4.

* `segment_memory_freq_threshold` The tolerance range for frequency in both positive and negative directions for two modes in two consecutive segments to be considered the same mode. Used to determine if the mode is sustained. Default: 0.15.
